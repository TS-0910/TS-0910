Hello! 👋 I'm an experienced Data Scientist, specializing in NLP and LLMs. I have proficiency in machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch, BERT, and transformers.

One of my key projects includes developing a Japanese BERT model for Grammar Error Correction and comparing it with ChatGPT. 
Here are my blog posts about that project: <br/>

Recently I've been doing research about LLM to fine-tune the model by adding additional dataset to make the model beter.

A firm believer in collaboration and knowledge sharing, I actively  author blog posts on advanced NLP methods.

Let's connect to discuss more about AI and opportunities to collaborate!
